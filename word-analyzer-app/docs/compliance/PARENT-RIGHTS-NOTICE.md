## What is Word Analyzer?

Word Analyzer is an iPad app that helps teachers assess how well your child reads aloud. Here's how it works:

1. Your child reads a passage out loud
2. The app records the audio
3. The app takes a picture of the text
4. The app figures out which words were read correctly
5. Your child gets a personalized encouraging message
6. The teacher can track your child's reading progress
