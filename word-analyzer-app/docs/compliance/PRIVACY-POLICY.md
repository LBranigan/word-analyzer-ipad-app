## How We Collect Information

### Audio Recordings
When a student reads aloud, the App records audio through the device's microphone. This recording is used solely to analyze reading accuracy and fluency. Audio recordings are stored temporarily (24 hours) for processing and then automatically deleted.

### Images of Reading Material
The App captures images of reading material (books, worksheets, etc.) to extract text using optical character recognition (OCR). Images are stored temporarily (24 hours) for processing and then automatically deleted.

### Student Profiles
Teachers or school administrators enter student names and grade levels to track assessment progress over time.

## How We Use Information

We use children's personal information **solely for educational purposes**:

1. **Assess Reading Proficiency** - Analyze pronunciation accuracy and fluency
2. **Track Progress** - Store assessment results to monitor improvement over time
3. **Generate Reports** - Create PDF and video reports of assessment results
4. **Identify Errors** - Detect patterns in reading errors to support instruction
5. **Provide Feedback** - Generate personalized AI summaries with voice playback

**We do NOT use children's information for:**
- Advertising or marketing
- Creating behavioral profiles for commercial purposes
- Selling or renting to third parties
- Training AI models (see Third-Party Services section)
- Any purpose unrelated to educational assessment

### Google Cloud Vision API
- **Data Shared:** Images of reading material (text only, no photos of children)
- **Purpose:** Extract text from images (OCR)
- **Data Retention:** Google processes and returns results; data is not stored for model training
- **Privacy Policy:** [Google Cloud Privacy](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice)

### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API

- **Purpose:** Generate personalized, encouraging feedback summaries
- **Data Retention:** Google processes and returns text; data is not used for model training when using API
- **Privacy Policy:** [Google AI Privacy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)

### Firebase (Google Cloud)
- **Data Shared:** Student names, grade levels, assessment results (text only)
- **Purpose:** Secure data storage, user authentication, temporary media storage
- **Data Retention:** Stored until deletion requested; media files auto-expire after 24 hours
- **Privacy Policy:** [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
